Hightlightsüìù:

- Since there were higher amount of clients with "high" fee structure (clients which have high service level, thus given more priority and more spending power &credit limit) had the highest credit balances in compare to ones which had "mid" and "low" fee structure. This part of the clients is thus the bank's revenue driver as well as risk exposure too.

- Apart from bank loans and business lendings the clients have an average of $275.37k worth of debt to them although it does not bother the bank in that much way.

- The bank has enough liquid money as observed by the comparision between deposits and loans for the time being.

- The risk wieghtage of "2" on a scale of 5 among all the clients is what we have here. This suggests that although there isn't much risk for the bank regarding it's debtors going bad, the bank shall stil put some measures to lower these chanes such strengthning their credit assessment process, using credit scoring and reviewing the clients credit history.
